I have also grown a bit tired of the bickering and general attitude that many editors are displaying that they would rather do things individually than to collaborate and work together. All of these just make it too hard for me to edit and do the things that I think need to be done to help the project.\n\nWith that said if the members of the project want to continue to have a working project with a collaboration and newsletter then some folks need to come forward and make that happen. I just don\'t have the time to wait 5 minutes for WP to load a page and then have to fight about everything. If anyone has questions or needs assistance I would be glad to help out but until WP can fix the screwy new updates there\'s not much I can do. --[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 15:35, 12 November 2011 (UTC)"6,WikiProject_Deletion_sorting,13908463,474407923,754619,FYI,Notifying AFDs,"\n\nI have just been [[WP:BOLD]] and modified both {{tl|Deletionlist}} and {{tl|Deletionlist-country}} to slightly strengthen the advice which appears at the top of each deletion sorting list regarding notifying an AFD discussion about its inclusion in a delsort list.\n\nThe guidance used to say: &quot;You can also tag the AfD by adding \'\'\'&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:delsort|Listname|~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;\'\'\'&quot;.\n\nHowever, the use of delsort at AFD now seems to be nearly universal, and so it seems right to me that its usage should be encouraged.  I have therefore strengthened the wording from &quot;can&quot; to &quot;should&quot;, so that the guidance now reads: &quot;You can also tag the AfD by adding \'\'\'&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:delsort|Listname|~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;\'\'\'&quot;.\n\nI hope this is uncontroversial, but thought it best to point out the change just in case. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&quot;&gt;Brown&lt;/span&gt;HairedGirl]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] Ã¢&#x20AC;Ë˜ ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:24, 1 February 2012 (UTC)"7,WikiProject_Deletion_sorting,13908463,443680080,7230848,REQ-DISCUSSION,Discussion notification,"\n\nGreetings.

Some students already have been using AFC, and given our strong push toward stub and start articles, I believe that it won\'t add much if any workload for the AFC team. We are also reducing the number of courses for next term to focus on quality rather than quantity, so we\'ll likely only have about 40 courses working on the English Wikipedia, so I doubt this would be more than 50 AFC requests total between now and May, and likely much fewer than that.

Although only an essay, WPJournals habitually uses [[WP:NJournals]] to determine whether a journal passes the notability bar. In recent weeks I have seen articles rejected that clearly pass this bar, and other articles created that don\'t pass this bar. The latter is more inconvenient than the former, as editors (especially newbies) may be surprised if an article that passed AFC is subsequently deleted (either by a PROD or an AfD). I realize that people here do a lot of work fighting against a backlog and handling articles on all kinds of topics, so I realize that it will be difficult to avoid this kind of situation, but I thought it might be helpful if I posted a note about this issue here anyway.

I have come across a quite diligent editor improving [[Cinema of India]] articles, and I strongly applaud his efforts.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dam_999#Caution]  However, I wish to get wider input here about whether or not [[WP:MOSFILM]] should be tweaked to more specifically address the use or not of bulleted crew lists. \n:Myself, I think that the more \'\'important\'\' members of production who are not already part of the infobox template, such as [[executive producer]], [[Creative consultant|project consultant]], [[script doctor]], [[production designer]], [[music director]], [[sound designer]], [[Graphics coordinator|graphics supervisor]], [[casting director]], [[make-up artist]], and [[costume designer]] (example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dam_999&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=465672205&amp;oldid=465671483]) should be best treated as sourced and informative prose... and not be simply a bullet list.\n::My suggested change to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Film#Production]] is that a sentence be added that states &quot;\'\'When including the more important members of production who are not already part of the infobox template, the information should be offered as sourced and informative prose and not as a list\'\'&quot;.\n:Again, the editor who used them at \'\'[[Dam 999]]\'\' is doing some terrific work and I do not wish to discourage him in any way. So I\'m hoping that MOSFILM can be tweaked to more specically instruct that lessor \'\'major\'\' crew may be included as prose and to discourage lessor \'\'major\'\' crew in less inciteful bullet lists.

To tag all of the US related articles would bring the project to several million articles.  Not really a manageable number.  Not to mention the number of pages to be flagged.  It would seem a lot better to make this more like a super project that by default allows contents to be listed from other projects so that the sub projects do not appear to be children of the huge project. As long as one project in the US does not wish to be included as a child of WPUS, either a second banner would need to be added or these articles would not be included in the scope of WPUS.  It would seem to be more efficient to just say WPABC should be included in WPUS and just not add or modify templates.  Don\'t know how this would actually work, but can we say that a Wikiproject that has a scope of over 50% of the articles in the encyclopedia works (I think the US may be 50%, anyone know)?  I\'m not knocking the project, just questioning if there is a better way to deal with a project that large.

I realize the number has to be set somewhere, but how was 60 met, and are there exceptions? For example, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting]] lists {{cl|Virginia geography stubs}} in {{cl|Overpopulated stub categories}}. Virginia has 95 counties and 40 independent cities that are essentially the same as counties, thus there could be 135 stubs. Only 17 have over the 50-page deletion guideline.  That leaves 118 potential categories that are instead merged into the parent category of Virginia geography stubs.  Say each of those stubs has only 10 associated articles, that would mean 1,180 pages going into {{cl|Virginia geography stubs}}. Another example of a category desperately in need of subcats is {{cl|United States history stubs}} with 623 pages, plus subcategories for US history books, US military history, and Old West. That category has everything from colonial settlements to Cold War tactics. My interest is in working on those stubs pertaining to the American Founding. I don\'t recognize on sight every article that touches on that time period, and with 623 it\'s time-consuming to click every link.\n\n[[WP:DIFFUSE]] does not give a limit to the size of categories, leaving only the guidance on the banner, &quot;subcategories may be helpful for browsing.&quot; If we are ok with Virginia geography stubs having 800 plus articles, that\'s cool with me. {{cl|American films}} has over 24,000 pages, but it also has 21 subcategories to help navigation. Leaving 800 pages in Virginia geography stubs does not make it easy for someone who might want to expand related articles. Say an editor wants to expand articles related to {cl|Spotsylvania County, Virginia geography stubs}}, 39 page listings will get lost among 800.\n\nOne possibility is to break up the county stubs into categories for region, which is partially in place. Still {{cl|Northern Virginia geography stubs}} has only 106 pages, while {{cl|Southwest Virginia geography stubs}} has 294. Also, those counties in the regional categories Would an exception be advantageous to editors in cases where stub categories have high cumulative article count?  When a stub category has a large and wide variety of pages, there needs to a better system of identifying what those stubs really are. Cheers.

I\'m working on an independent website that will serve as an archive of college football uniforms, similar to the [http://www.gridironuniforms.com/homeindex.html Gridiron Uniform Database] and I\'m looking for contributors who would be willing to help out. Creating a website depicting just one year of 100+ teams\' worth of uniforms is a Herculean task for just one man.

These occasions need to be clearly stated in the text and the race results table needs to indicate that the driver did not start the race from his grid slot. The &quot;PL&quot; indicator doesn\'t seem to be working for some editors, me included, but leaving the grid position alone in the table is not acceptable. For those readers casually looking at the race table, it appears that the driver started from his slot on the grid, so it\'s misleading and inaccurate.

It mentions Alguersuari starting from the pitlane in the qualifying table when the race table is more appropriate. Pitlane starts have nothing to do with qualifying. At the [[2010 Bahrain Grand Prix]], both HRTs started from the pitlane - there\'s nothing indicating that at all in the article, which is again misleading and inaccurate, and we shouldn\'t be satisfied with it. There was a previous discussion about this here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Formula_One/Archive_16#Drivers.27_that_start_from_pitlane].

My question would be where this trade should be listed. There are two possibilities, either [[2011â€“12 NHL transactions]] or [[2012â€“13 NHL transactions]]. An argument for 2011â€“12 would be the time of the trade. Listing it at 2012â€“13 would also be possible due to the fact that his entry contract will expire on June 30, making the trade comparable to others where the rights to high-profile players had been swapped.

If I recall correctly, adding notable wins had no consensus in favor. This has already been discussed in the past (see [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts/Archive_3#.22Notable_wins.22_sections|here]]) and it was agreed that such texts should be removed as they don\'t really add much to the articles. In my personal opinion, I believe that adding notable victories goes against the guidelines at [[WP:LEAD]] and, more importantly, against [[WP:NPV]], one of the core policies, because who is notable is subjective and the moment that this kind of text is put on, it immediately suggests that those fighters that were mentioned there are more notable than others. So, I propose to add a note in the \'\'Lead section\'\' section of the guidelines to discourage such texts. Something like &quot;\'\'Do not add notable victories/wins in the lead section as that does not represent a concise overview of the article and does not present a [[WP:NPV|neutral point of view]].&quot;\n\nPlease share your opinions on this issue in order to generate a consensus to make the guidelines clearer, either by rejecting notable victories in the lead section or by accepting them and establishing guidelines on how to evaluate when a victory is notable enough to deserve being mentioned in the lead section.

I wrote [[net register tonnage]] and created {{tl|NRT}} as the former previously redirected to [[tonnage]] and the latter is needed as a companion for {{tl|GRT}}. In addition I corrected factual errors in [[net tonnage]] which basically described NRT in the lead section. However, I also went through {{tl|GT}} and {{tl|NetT}}, adding strikethroughs to several parameters that, when used, spell the tonnage out in &quot;tons&quot;. This is obviously incorrect as both gross and net tonnages are dimensionless/unitless indices calculated with a mathematical formula. Thus \'\'first=yes\'\' and \'\'first=caps\'\' should not be used in future articles Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; hence the striking.\n\nOf course, being a reasonable editor, I did not touch the templates as it would have affected a large number of articles. However, the documentation can not be left as it is now for ever, so either we should edit the existing parameters so that they do not spell out &quot;tons&quot; (and hope that not many articles are affected in a negative way) or add completely new parameters that denote the tonnage correctly (e.g. &quot;Gross tonnage (GT) of 36,000&quot;), remove the old ones from the documentation and then fix the incorrect notation when encountered (or perhaps with the AWB Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; I\'m not experienced with that so I don\'t know how it works).

Is there really a need to have categories for every known certification level from every country that has an organization that certifies albums and singles as found under [[:Category:Certified albums]] and [[:Category:Certified singles]]? Albums like \'\'[[As I Am]]\'\', \'\'[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]\'\', \'\'[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]\'\' are categorized in 19, 18, and 12 such categories, respectively. \n# It\'s overcategorization. \n# It doesn\'t define the album. How does each one individually represent a defining characteristic of the album. How does being certified gold in Italy or platinum in the UK define the album?  While, after the fact, an album may be described as a &quot;platinum-selling album&quot;, it means different things in different countries based on the sales level that makes the album platinum and only applies to those countries in which it was certified platinum. \n# It\'s not accurate. An album that is certified platinum in the US does not lose its gold album status, but the album is only being categorized by its highest level of certification. Although this could be fixed by making the gold albums category a parent category to platinum albums and so on.\nThanks for any feedback. --[[User:Starcheerspeaksnewslostwars|Starcheerspeaksnewslostwars]] ([[User talk:Starcheerspeaksnewslostwars|talk]]) 15:47, 16 August 2011 (UTC)"315,WikiProject_Albums,145913,501126200,10962883,REQ-OPINION,Intent to remove Artistdirect from the list of reliable sources,"\n\nThe background (from what I can make out):\n*[[Artistdirect]] was added to the list of review sources by a [[WP:SPA|SPA]] IP editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63348056 here], as their very first edit ever, with no preliminary discussion or even an edit summary.

If the only major changes in prose are going to be minor points of identification (eg overall size, hinge tooth structure, type locality) then creating a single comprehensive genus article is recommended, with the species being covered as subsections in the genus article.  See \'\'[[Lambeosaurus]]\'\' and \'\'[[Palaeovespa]]\'\' for examples.  On the occasion where the species sections may be overwhelming the rest of a genus article then they may be split out into a &quot;Species of \'\'xxx\'\'&quot; article (eg \'\'[[Psittacosaurus]]\'\' and [[Species of Psittacosaurus]]).  These guidelines cover almost all fossil taxa excepting ones that are from about the last ice age to modern times many of which are more well known and defined then older taxa.  Also it is not meant to cover extinct species which are placed into living genera, such as \'\'[[Equisetum thermale]]\'\', where the other discussed species have stand alone articles.--[[User:Kevmin|&lt;font color=&quot;#120A8F&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Kevmin|&lt;font color=&quot;#228B22&quot;&gt;min&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Kevmin|Â§]] 22:53, 17 February 2012 (UTC)\n\nDaggers\nThe use of daggers is generally restricted to taxoboxes and taxa lists in articles.  When an extinct taxon is mentioned in running prose of a living taxons article it is normally noted to be extinct, thus removing the need to mark it with a dagger.  Similarly in an article on an extinct taxon, the status of the taxon as extinct should usually noted in the first or second line of the introductory prose.  Daggers are used in the body of an article generally only in taxon lists.  Thus a \'\'[[List of Acer species]]\'\' will have a notation at the top explaining the presence of the â€ , while the species themselves are formated thus:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;nowiki&gt;â€ \'\'[[Acer stonebergae]]\'\' &lt;small&gt;[[Jack A. Wolfe|Wolfe]] &amp; [[Toshimasa Tanai|Tanai]]&lt;/small&gt; ([[Early Eocene]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]] &amp; [[British Columbia]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfe1987&quot;/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt; \nwhich gives this&lt;br/&gt;\nâ€ \'\'[[Acer stonebergae]]\'\' &lt;small&gt;[[Jack A.

The dagger is used in a taxobox to mark the extinct levels of the taxonomy from the extant ones, with the first instance of a dagger linked to the extinction article (eg &lt;nowiki&gt;{{extinction}} or [[extinct|â€ ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  If you use the automatic taxoboxes, the taxonomy template has a built in parameter for marking a taxon extinct. --[[User:Kevmin|&lt;font color=&quot;#120A8F&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Kevmin|&lt;font color=&quot;#228B22&quot;&gt;min&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Kevmin|Â§]] 22:53, 17 February 2012 (UTC) \n\nAutomatic taxoboxes\nThe use of automatic taxoboxes is by no means a universally accepted practice.  WP: Paleontology is the only project that has adopted use of them for all new articles created.  Yes the explanatory documentation needs to be reworked a bit to make it intuitive for users.  I think use at both the WP:Gastropods and WP: Bivalves could be beneficial as the higher taxonomies of both are, for the most part,  in flux at this point.  Creation of the taxonomy templates is not very difficult, and conversion of a taxobox to an automatic taxobox is also not complex.  A lot of the work involved actually comes from the initial creation of the first few taxon template groups, after those are done, other lower level templates link in fairly quickly.  I will be the first to admit that I don\'t know nearly every in and out of the automatic taxoboxes or the speciesboxes, but the users who maintain/work on them will help with problems.  I think a lot of what is needed to clarify the documentation is more new eyes there working with us to clarify and streamline.

[[WP:POLICY#Naming]] generally discourages the use of terms like &quot;guideline&quot; or &quot;policy&quot; in page names even for regular policies anyway.  So some of the WikiProjects are renaming their pages to something like &quot;Article advice&quot;, &quot;Recommendations&quot;, or &quot;Style advice&quot;.  This is just a friendly suggestion that your group consider doing the same.  There are templates listed at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide#Advice_pages]] if you want to tag the pages that way.  \n\nWhile you\'re at it, if it\'s been a long time since anyone overhauled those pages, this might be a good time to do that, too.  I don\'t know what the history is for your group, but it\'s pretty typical for a page to get written and then neglected for a long time.  If you happen to find anything that no longer matches up with the community-wide Manual of Style or other general guidelines, then perhaps it would be good to fix it.

This user is engaging in two maneuvers simultaneously.  On the one hand, he is attempting to modify the article so that it\'s about the general concept of \'\'gerim\'\' and \'\'toshavim\'\' in Tanakh, and on the other hand, he is then arguing that the title of the article should be changed into English.\n\nI\'ve tried explaining to him that [[Ger toshav]] is a halakhic category, but he seems not to understand this.  Or perhaps it\'s that he thinks any midrashic linkage between that category and the phrase _’_¨ _•_ª_•_©_‘ in Tanakh means that all uses of that phrase or any similar phrase must be referring to the halakhic [[Ger toshav]].\n\nI\'ve pointed out the difference between the articles on [[Shabbat]] and [[Biblical Sabbath]], the one being a Hebrew titled article discussing a halakhic concept and the other being an English titled article discussing a general Biblical concept that, while it is obviously related to the halakhic concept, has an entirely different focus.

Most electoral divisions take the name of a village or town within them; typically the largest or the one nearest the centre. But this is an arbitrary concordance; there may be multiple census villages in a single ED, or none at all; some villages\' population spans multiple EDs (browse tables 5 and 6 to see this). Calling Kinvara ED the environs of Kinvara village is as incorrect as calling County Donegal the environs of Donegal town. The fact that one is named after the other and encompasses it is not relevant.

Also, Yugoslavia was not a royalist dictatorship from 1918 to 1929 when the plain tricolour was in use. (C) the SFRY tricolour itself was based upon the original plain tricolour and the plain tricolour is also a historical flag of Yugoslavia. (D) DIREKTOR needs to present sources to provide evidence that the plain tricolour flag was a symbol exclusively of Yugoslav royalism and Serb supremacism during its use from 1918 to 1943.\n4) DIREKTOR and other users\' response: have stated that since this was the last flag used in Yugoslavia, it should be used in the template."448,WikiProject_Yugoslavia,4170038,445876708,20318,REQ-DISCUSSION,election article names,"\n\nPlease see [[Talk:Yugoslavian parliamentary election, May 1992#Requested move]]. --[[User:Joy|Joy &amp;#91;shallot&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Joy|talk]]) 20:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)"449,WikiProject_Yugoslavia,4170038,495423193,11127842,FYI,Scope of the project,"\n\nI noticed coordinated activities of several users aimed to deny FR Yugoslavia any Yugoslav legacy and to distinct the term Yugoslavia from the third Yugoslavia, (FR Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro).

Obviously Danica was signed as a Stewart-Haas driver, however after a little sleuthing this page - http://www.nascar.com/drivers/list/cup/dps/ - on the NASCAR website definitely indicates that the #10 is fielded by Tommy Baldwin for both Danica and Reuti. This does go with the details of the points deal to give Danica her guaranteed spot in the 500. Per [http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/Danica_Patrick_to_have_guaranteed_Daytona_500_spot_thanks_to_deal_with_Tommy_Baldwin_Racing.html]:\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;NASCAR does not allow points to be bought but does allow the transfer of points as long as the original owner maintains a minority ownership stake in the car.

One I found today is for the star HIP 32246 ([[Epsilon Geminorum]]) in the [http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3 VizieR database entry] for [http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?2011MNRAS.410..190T&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1 Tetzlaff et al (2011)].

[[WP:POLICY#Naming]] generally discourages the use of terms like &quot;guideline&quot; or &quot;policy&quot; in page names even for regular policies anyway.  So some of the WikiProjects are renaming their pages to something like &quot;Article advice&quot;, &quot;Recommendations&quot;, or &quot;Style advice&quot;.  This is just a friendly suggestion that your group consider doing the same.  There are templates listed at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide#Advice_pages]] if you want to tag the pages that way.  \n\nWhile you\'re at it, if it\'s been a long time since anyone overhauled those pages, this might be a good time to do that, too.  I don\'t know what the history is for your group, but it\'s pretty typical for a page to get written and then neglected for a long time.  If you happen to find anything that no longer matches up with the community-wide Manual of Style or other general guidelines, then perhaps it would be good to fix it.

Anyway, I was wondering what the rest of you might think about specific sub-categories for clergy and academics who may have converted to one religion or religious group who had earlier been members of the group from which they had converted, and, also, what phrasing for the category name(s) might be most useful.

As I\'m new to the Whoniverse - I only started watching when Matt Smith took on the role, and so far am mostly familiar only with the new series - I\'ve found myself wanting to learn more about things referred to in the series that have a history beyond that which I know.  So I\'ve started reading the articles available on Wikipedia, and have discovered that there is a decided lack of copyediting consistency for recurring terms across the articles.  To mention but one that I\'ve noticed, the TARDIS\'s \'\'\'Chameleon Circuit\'\'\' is sometimes notated as a proper name, at other times as just a noun, and at others with an incomprehensible mix of upper and lower case.\n\nWhat I\'d like to do is look for a consensus of opinion on how items like this should be notated across the \'\'\'\'\'Doctor Who\'\'\'\'\' articles; then, as I read them, I will endeavour to edit recurring terms so they are consistent.  Here are a few of the terms I\'ve noticed; this is, of course, far from an exhaustive list, and I\'d appreciate suggestions for additions from more experience hands.\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Doctor Who\'\'\'\'\' Terms\n\nChameleon Circuit\nChristmas Specials\nTARDIS\'s (possessive; going by the ending of the base word, instead of the acronym)\nRevived series when referred to in the body of an article.  As an example, &quot;River Song, not seen since the _series 4_ two-part episode \'Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead\'...&quot;\nChameleon Arch\n\nBTW, I\'m not looking to make changes to article text for the most part.  I don\'t know enough about most of Doctor Who to be able to determine what is or isn\'t trivia, what should or shouldn\'t be included, or how to edit down a summary that\'s been designated too long; I\'m just going to copyedit.  I will attempt some actual writing on the Eleventh Doctor\'s series; I know those well enough that I feel comfortable trying to make some of the changes that are needed, based on what the boxes at the top of the articles say need doing.  I state this because I see there is an editor named MarnetteD who is working on removing trivia, and I want to make clear that I don\'t see our efforts overlapping or conflicting.  Also, once a consensus is reached on notation, may I be so bold as to suggest that these be added to the \'\'\'\'\'Doctor Who\'\'\'\'\' Manual of Style?  Because honestly, when I noticed this issue, I checked both the Wikipedia Manual of Style and the \'\'\'\'\'Doctor Who\'\'\'\'\' Manual of Style, and didn\'t find a solution for the majority of this, the differences between notating series, serials and seasons excepted.\n\nI look forward to a lively discussion. --[[User:Sherlockspock|Sherlockspock]] ([[User talk:Sherlockspock|talk]]) 14:08, 29 July 2011 (UTC)"616,WikiProject_Doctor_Who,2773469,466975276,274040,REQ-DISCUSSION,Reorganising and merging into List of Doctor Who serials,"\n\nHi all,\n\nI\'ve opened a discussion [[Talk:List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#The_Great_Update_of_Christmas_2011|at the serial list talk]] to a) merge the chronology into the episode list (per Masem), and b) standardise the episode lists with others on the site.

After that happens only a few times, they will get discouraged and start editing the article. Then they get in trouble for being the most obviously COI editors possible, and then they start socking.\n\nDo we need a template or some other means of communicating directly with COI editors to let them know to put a note for help up on [[WP:COIN]] after commenting on an article\'s talk page unless it\'s high traffic?

There\'s some overlap between these two projects. If you imagine a Venn diagram there\'d be some overlap. Whether two separate projects is useful I\'m not sure. Possibly not.\n\nI guess the thrust of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Cooperation]] is more or less &quot;Paid editing is a positive good, and what we need to do is help paid agents navigate the various rules and pitfalls so that they can get their material into the Wikipedia&quot; while the intended thrust of this project is more like &quot;Paid editing is very problematic, and ought to be either outright banned or, if not, viewed with extreme skepticism&quot;.\n\nWhere there\'s some overlap is the question of controlling paid editors. Participants in both projects agree that, inasmuch as paid agents are currently permitted, they ought be controlled in some ways. But the thrust of this project is &quot;watched with gimlet eye&quot; while the thrust of the other project is more like &quot;encouraged and mentored&quot;, I guess. Which is right is a matter of opinion I guess.\n\nI note that something called CREWE (Corporate Representatives for Ethical Wikipedia Engagement) was [http://www.facebook.com/groups/crewe.group/?notif_t=group_activity formed on Facebook] about a week ago and already has over 100 members. These are high-powered full time experienced and subtle and clever PR people, and it\'s kind of daunting to think about going up against them. Of course if one takes the view that the word &quot;Ethical&quot; in their title constitutes proof of ethical intent, it\'s not a problem. I suppose that people with that outlook on life must own a lot of [[ShamWow]]s, but maybe that\'s OK.\n\nOh well. It\'s a complicated issue. If the general philosophy of this Wikiproject does indeed represent a distinct minority view, it arguably shouldn\'t go forward, as pressing contentious minority views isn\'t usually a good idea.\n\n\'\'We\'\' don\'t have any money to hand out here, but we can make awards!

The venue is similar to FAC in which the editor can support or oppose an article as well as offer comments to help with its improvement. See [[WP:HWY/ACR]] for an affective A-class review process that has successfully prepared articles for FAC.

The &quot;Series&quot; should also be all lower-case, and both changes would put the articles in line with  Asimov\'s third connected series, the [[Foundation series]].\n\n[[Robot series]] already exists as a disambiguation article (linking to a series of video games and this series), so I propose the first article should be renamed [[Robot series (Asimov)]].\n\nA proposal to move [[Isaac Asimov\'s Galactic Empire series]] (when it was called [[Isaac Asimov\'s Galactic Empire Series]]) was [[Talk:Isaac Asimov\'s Galactic Empire series#Proposed move|discussed four years ago]], but with only one voter, no consensus was reached to move it to [[Empire series]] (which now links to the page), but the &quot;Series&quot; was made lower-case at the time (a quirk which still remains on the Robot Series article).\n\nThere is some confusion over whether the second series should be called the &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series or just &quot;Empire&quot; series. Here on WP the article is Galactic Empire, but the infoboxes, templates etc. found on all the articles refer to the series as &quot;Empire&quot;. I think the confusion arises from the books: publisher\'s lists of Asimov books (e.g. [[Grafton (publisher)|Grafton]]) refer to the series\' as the &quot;Galactic Empire Novels&quot; and &quot;Robot Stories and Novels&quot;, but Asimov himself talked about his &quot;Empire novels&quot; and &quot;Robot novels&quot;/&quot;robot short stories&quot; (e.g. in his Author\'s Note to [[Prelude to Foundation]]).

We have partnered with Answerlab to carry out this study with us in San Francisco, Chicago, and Dallas.  \n\nShould you be interested, your participation would involve 3 activities:  1) Complete short online homework assignments, writing about yourself and/or your daily habits 2) Participate in a short phone interview in mid-September and 3) Participate in a 2 hour face-to-face interview to be conducted on or close to October 4th, 5th, and 6th (date and times to be confirmed).  The Wikimedia Foundation generally discourages any research agency from offering monetary incentives for participation, but all participants of this study will be offered a monetary gift as our thanks.  More importantly, we can assure you an interesting conversation, excitement for Wikipedia and its mission, and our gratitude and appreciation.  \n\nYour participation would be extremely valuable to us and will help shape the strategy and development of the Wikipedia mobile properties and experience.  It is also key to helping us better understand the more specific needs of editors like you so that we can support those processes.  In addition to Wikipedia editors, we\'ll also be speaking with Wikipedia users in Chicago, as well as in SF and Dallas.  We have recently conducted similar work in India  and Brazil.  Please see [http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mobile/Research here] and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Projects here] for more on this work.  \n\nIf you\'d like to participate, please let us know by replying to myself and/or Brennan, Nick, Sal, and the other folks at Answerlab at editwiki@answerlab.com by September 10th.

I singled out [[Triangle (The X-Files)]] as it\'s one of our best articles; and on getting a second opinion from Glimmer I added the class to that article. Nothing earth-shattering has happened since, and so I\'m wondering if it\'s something we now want to consider doing on a regular basis. We\'re a small project so a review structure like [[WP:MILHIST]]\'s is totally out of the question; however, perhaps a sub page for editors to add a nomination that \'\'they\'\' feel is worthy of the status (not one they\'ve worked on themselves), so that someone coming along afterwards can pick that nomination up, be the second opinion, and approve or deny it. That would streamline the process a little, and would allow a slow trickle of nominations so that we could manage it on a low level while we\'re still getting used to it. I think there\'s still a few articles that could be promoted, such as [[Beyond the Sea (The X-Files)]], so there\'s definitely some initial room to expand.

However, given that there\'s no real criteria for demarcation, it has led to some disagreement when it comes to individual episodes, and also falls somewhat into the realm of original research. I propose that the two-star system simply be replaced by a single marker, listing only those episodes which have been released on the &quot;X-Files Mythology&quot; DVD sets - that serves as a more official stance on things, and follows the Wikipedia principle of reporting recorded information rather than interpreting it ourselves. It would simply entail listing those episodes included on the DVDs with one asterisk, or perhaps another marker such as a superscript letter M (it doesn\'t really matter I guess), and amending the explanatory note to explain that these are the episodes considered by the producers to belong to the mythology proper.

As it is, we could probably work through the seasons gradually for GT status, given enough time, although personally I only have secondary sourcing for the first four or five. I quite like the idea of overhauling one of the character lists to be something much more encyclopaedic, rather than a plot dump - if we tackled either [[List of The X-Files characters]] or [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters on The X-Files]], we could each name a few characters whose entries we\'d be responsible for, trimming out anything trivial or not given secondary sourcing, and have a plot/production/reception breakdown for each one. I think the Monster-of-the-Week list could be split up by season, though, since it\'s rather large. Anyone keen on something like this, or have any other ideas?

One of the questions I asked in the survey was &quot;What kind of technical changes do you think would improve the dispute resolution process on Wikipedia?&quot; and a common response was something along the lines of &quot;reduce the amount of dispute resolution forums&quot;. This was supported in another question, &quot;What issues do you see that make dispute resolution difficult?&quot; where 43% said that there are too many dispute resolution forums, 39% said dispute resolution is too complex, and 30% said that dispute resolution is inaccessible and too hard to find. With this in mind, a few of us have been discussion about how to simplify things. This is just an early idea but like all things is one worth discussing. Part of the issue with dispute resolution is lack of continuity. A possible fix to this may be to amalgamate many of the random dispute resolution forums into a SPI style format, and it could act as a central record for all disputes. Once resolved, it could be archived and referred back to as necessary. In the concept idea, processes like RFC would stay in place, and MedCom or ArbCom would remain unaffected. It would solve the issue of complexity - essentially it would be a one-stop shop for dispute resolution, and could be a simplified format, structured in a way to make it a catch-all i.e.: a question in the request format like &quot;What is the issue you are bringing here&quot; or words to that effect which could generate responses like &quot;Me and User:Example cannot agree whether X source is reliable&quot; or &quot;I\'m concerned that X content inserted by user Y in article Z may have BLP issues&quot;. I would also think that WQA could be closed - RFC\'s in the past as well as the survey have identified issues with WQA and it may be time to consider marking it as historical - but that\'s a discussion for later.

It may appear that very little has been happening on the surface, but in honesty many of us have been in discussions, with ideas on how to improve dispute resolution. Some of these discussions are still in progress, so I can\'t say a lot, but possible proposals will be the streamlining of dispute resolution, by simplifying or eliminating some dispute resolution processes. The early results of the dispute resolution survey have shown a lot of improvement is needed, and has highlighted some of the more problematic dispute resolution forums. Over the next week or two, I will start compiling the results of the survey, and will then write them up - though some early aggregate results may be thrown around in discussions to see if we can move a few reforms a bit quicker. My first aim is to address WQA - it has fared the worst in the survey for effectiveness, by quite a lot, and an alternative process is something we should maybe look into. \n\nI\'d love to get the discussion going again. It\'s been rather quiet here recently, and I\'ve been so busy jumping through hoops to get the survey rolled out that I\'ve missed a lot, but also haven\'t had much time to move things along. Let\'s throw out ideas again, perhaps start with a discussion on WQA and possible alternatives. We\'re a clever bunch and I\'d like to see what we can come up with.

These are all important principles and guidelines, of course, but I think probably the most important thing for new editors to know is that they should get help if they get into a dispute, and get help early. I propose inserting links to [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution]] in all similar talk page templates, and to include wording like &quot;use dispute resolution early&quot; or &quot;get outside help early&quot;.
